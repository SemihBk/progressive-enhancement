          <p class="text bold-paragraph">
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They
            said,
          </p>

          <blockquote class="villagers">
            “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.”
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">The farmer said,</p>

          <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote>

          <p class="text">
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
            and in the evening everybody came back and said,
          </p>

          <blockquote class="villagers">
            “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have
            eight horses!”
          </blockquote>

          <p class="text">The farmer again said,</p>

          <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote>

          <p class="text">
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and
            while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then
            said,
          </p>

          <blockquote class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</blockquote>
          <p class="text">and the farmer responded,</p>

          <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote>
          <p class="text">
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
            people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
            broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
          </p>

          <blockquote class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote>
          <p class="text">Again, he said,</p>

          <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote>

          <p class="text">
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
            complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
            happens in it is <strong class="good">good</strong> or
            <strong class="bad">bad</strong> — because you never know what will
            be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will
            be the consequences of good fortune.

            Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys,
            but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out
            of it...
